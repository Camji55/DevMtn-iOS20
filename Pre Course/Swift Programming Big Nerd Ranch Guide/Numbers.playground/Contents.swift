//What is the binary representation of -1 using an 8-bit signed integer?
1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1
-2^7  2^6   2^5   2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 - 128 = -1

//If you took that same bit pattern and interpreted it as an 8-bit unsigned integer, what would the value be?
1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1
2^7   2^6   2^5   2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255
